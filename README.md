I'm Tim, and I am a software engineer with a focus on data science and enriching people's lives with great tools. I graduated from Holberton School's two-year full-stack engineering program in January 2022, and I am looking to find a great team to join and push my skills. I love working with Python and have had a great time getting closer to the metal with C.
